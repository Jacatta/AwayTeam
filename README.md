GAME FLOW
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Ship/Space : - Not Started - Fly around solar systems

Deployment :
Taking directly from Star Trek the player must allocate people from their crew which consists of
teams:    
    Red- Military
    Yellow - Engineering
    Blue - Science
To embark on away missions to beautiful and hazardous worlds in search of new life, new technologies and exotic discoveries.

PlanetSide :
Taking from Civilizations, the players teams spawn on a hex based continent with a heavy fog of war feel. You must do the early exploration/ scanning of local wildlife. Also keeping an eye out for anomalies and lost technologies.
fighting will also have to be in here much like civ

Manifest:
Updates player on current status and new loot
player can upgrade units from here

-Back to ship. 
----------------------------------------------------------------------


Leveling up crewmen: crewmen body (all crewmen ) will upgrade as if 1 unit. 
once they gain 1 upgrade they choose their color. R/Y/B
from here they can choose 3 specialties upon the next level
Ex: Red Military - Offense/Defence/Scout

These main classes will effect their stats and abilities they can learn. 
The subclasses further develop their ability tree.

on top of planet side abilities, maybe shipside skills? (for later dev)
Allows specific upgrades to ship, ex: military = weapons, Engineering= better scanning.

8/7/17- Focusing on PlanetSide. Playing around with more of the GUI concepts which is fun.
Need to focus on Fog of War likely via a Hex State Machine. NOTE-press b to spawn blue team.
